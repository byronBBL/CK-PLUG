Debate over Darwin 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Darwinism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics .

This first phase of the mint was officially opened on 17 December 1968 by the royal attendance of Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Philip and their son Prince Charles . Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales ; however , such protests failed to materialise . The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from virgin metals completing the full minting process . Upon completion the final cost for the land , buildings and plant came to \u00a3 8 million . Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin , a gold sovereign , was struck in London in November 1975 . In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin - related acts , the Coinage Act of 1971 was passed , which among other things effectively abolished the individual role of Master of the Mint . Under this act , the Chancellor of the Exchequer took over the role , with a Deputy Master being appointed by the Treasury to exercise all the powers and duties of the Master within the mint .", "answer": ["1968"]}, {"question": "who sold out jesus for 30 pieces of silver?", "context": "Thirty pieces of silver was the price for which Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus , according to an account in the Gospel of Matthew 26 : 15 in the New Testament .

Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection , and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy . However , he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats . Bill asks about the death of Mandy , whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who 'd `` sacrificed '' herself to prevent Bill 's punishment , and about the disappearance of Nick , the piano player . Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle .

Harley Davidson ( Mickey Rourke ) , dressed in biker gear , with ultra-short dyed hair , hears from the radio about a dangerous new street drug named `` Crystal Dream '' . ( The significance of this street drug does not become clear until later . ) Harley goes into a rough bar and sees a cowboy - looking fellow ( Don Johnson wearing a beard , cowboy hat and boots ) . He has scammed a fellow in a pool game but has to use strong measures when the fellow refuses payment . Harley helps him in this . We learn that they are old friends ( later we learn the name he goes by is The Marlboro Man . ) They visit a blues ( old jazz ? ) bar in Burbank , which they both hold special . They go into a back room and meet Jack Daniels , an extremely - heavily - muscled lad , who immediately goes to fight Harley due to an old feud over a woman . After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley . Marlboro borrows Harley 's Harley and baits a motorcycle cop , with interesting results . In a bit of psychological revelation , we learn that he is in an intermittent amorous relationship with a beautiful woman , who tells him that she is going to settle down with another man , as she is not getting enough loving from him . He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money . Chance Wilder ( Tom Sizemore ) , president of the Great Trust branch , is obviously involved in drug dealing . Harley and Marlboro go to the bank . Showing considerable balls , Harley negotiates an exchange - the drugs for $2.5 M. The exchange goes down smoothly in a visually - fascinating airplane graveyard , but then the bank 's squad of soldiers finds them celebrating at the bar and it is not pretty , although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money . In a running battle , Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily - declining elements of the squad until a final showdown in the penthouse suite of the Great Trust bank .

without drinking and is still struggling with addiction and gambling . Now sober , she strives to be a good example to her son Roscoe , and regain the trust of her daughter Violet , who is revealed to be pregnant herself in the first episode . In addition , she is trying to iron out the rough edges in her relationship with her mother Bonnie , who never learned to play her role well and who would rather go out and drink than baby - sit . Christy later finds out that her biological father ran out on Bonnie on Christmas Eve , the day before Christy was born , and locates the man as a now - married father of two sons who runs an auto repair shop . </Li> <Li> Allison Janney as Bonnie Plunkett : Christy 's mother , a joyful if cynical recovering addict who is now grateful with life .

A pleasant Jewish couple was going to adopt her , yet Bonnie pulled out finally . From that point on , she attempted her best to raise Christy , however Christy wound up raising herself as Bonnie drank heavily and took tranquilizes and got back home late .

After having her boyfriend Luke 's baby , Violet made the decision to place her baby for adoption because she felt that this was the best way to break her family 's repeated cycle of poor life choices and give her child a better chance than she , her mother , or her grandmother ever had . During season 2 , in a brief downward spiral of bad behavior , Violet cheats on Luke and he breaks up with her . She later gets engaged to Gregory Munchnik , a psychology professor at her university , but he breaks the engagement after she relapses - she has since been behaving in a gold digger-esque manner with other men .

A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948 , reuniting Annam and Tonkin , but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina 's legal status .

Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area , a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time .

In this adaptation , her identity is Isabel Maru , a Spanish chemist recruited by General Erich Ludendorff to create chemical weapons for the German army . Due to facial disfigurement , she wears a ceramic mask over the left side of her face . It marks the character 's first live action appearance , although the setting is World War I rather than the World War II setting of the comic books . When Steve Trevor steals a book of Doctor Maru 's notes on her new chemical weapons that would render the gas masks useless against them , he crash - lands on Themyscira during his escape , which alerts Diana to the current war . She initially believes that Ares is directly responsible for the war , but later learns that all he did was provide a few ideas for the weapons to the likes of Maru while the decision to use the weapons was still the choice of the humans themselves . Ares attempts to sway Diana to his point of view by offering her a chance to kill Maru for her sins and part in the war , but Diana rejects his offer upon realizing of Trevor 's sacrifice that inspires her to recognize that she must accept humanity for its flaws rather than condemn it for not being perfect .

The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco .

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction . With continual improvements made to microscopes over time , magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century . This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke , and began the scientific study of cells , also known as cell biology . Over a century later , many debates about cells began amongst scientists . Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration , and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life .

In late August , 22,000 men ( including 9,000 Hessians ) were rapidly landed on Long Island using flat bottomed boats , this would be the largest amphibious operation undertaken by the British army until the Normandy landings almost 200 years later . In the ensuing Battle of Long Island on August 27 , 1776 , the British outflanked the American positions , driving the Americans back to the Brooklyn Heights fortifications . General Howe not wishing to risk the lives of his men in a bloody frontal assault then began to lay siege works . The navy had failed to properly blockade the East river which left an escape route open for Washington 's army , which he fully exploited , managing a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear to Manhattan Island . British forces then fought a series of actions to consolidate control of Manhattan Island , culminating in the Battle of Fort Washington which resulted in the capture of close to 3,000 Continental troops . Following the conquest of Manhattan , Howe ordered Charles Cornwallis to `` clear the rebel troops from New Jersey without a major engagement , and to do it quickly before the weather changed . '' Cornwallis ' force drove Washington 's army entirely from New Jersey and across the Delaware River . However , in the pre-dawn hours of December 26 , Washington crossed back into New Jersey and captured a garrison of Hessians at Trenton . Several days later , Washington outmaneuvered Cornwallis at Assunpink Creek and overwhelmed a British outpost at Princeton on January 3 , 1777 . Cornwallis rallied and again drove Washington away , however the defeats showed the British army had become too overstretched and Howe abandoned most of his outposts in New Jersey .", "answer": ["New York"]}, {"question": "what is the female lion called in lion king?", "context": "Nala ( voiced by Moira Kelly in The Lion King , The Lion King ll : Simba 's Pride , and The Lion King 11\u20442 , and Gabrielle Union in The Lion Guard ) is the daughter of Sarafina , the best friend and later wife of Simba and Kiara and Kion 's mother .

Giorno attempts to steal Koichi 's luggage , but is stopped by Koichi 's Stand , Echoes Act Three . Giorno recognized his power as being a Stand power similar to his Gold Experience , a Stand that can give life to inanimate objects . The story then follows Giorno as he tries to become a boss of the mafia in order to make Naples a better place and help its people , specifically where availability of drugs to young people are concerned . After an altercation with gang member Leaky Eye Luka , he attempts to join Passione , an organized crime group that employs many Stand users ( essentially , his vision for Passione is akin to Robin Hood 's band , in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader ) . He is approached by a member of Passione , Bruno Bucciarati , who suspects him of killing Luka . During the fight readers are introduced to Buciarati 's Stand , Sticky Fingers , that can place and open a zipper on any surface . Bucciarati challenges Giorno to complete the rite to join Passione , and therefore visit the Capo , Polpo , in prison .", "answer": ["2001"]}, {"question": "who plays caesar planet of the apes 2014?", "context": "<Li> Andy Serkis as Caesar , a common chimpanzee and the leader of the evolved ape tribe </Li>", "answer": ["Andy Serkis"]}, {"question": "who plays caesar planet of the apes 2014?", "context": "<Li> Andy Serkis as Caesar , a common chimpanzee and the leader of the evolved ape tribe </Li>", "answer": ["Andy Serkis"]}, {"question": "who plays caesar planet of the apes 2014?", "context": "<Li> Andy Serkis as Caesar , a common chimpanzee and the leader of the evolved ape tribe </Li>", "answer": ["Andy Serkis"]}, {"question": "where did the dewey decimal system come from?", "context": "The Dewey Decimal Classification ( DDC ) , or Dewey Decimal System , is a proprietary library classification system first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876 .

It is widely rumored that the Cowboys sought a guarantee that they would regularly host Thanksgiving games as a condition of their very first one ( since games on days other than Sunday were uncommon at the time and thus high attendance was not a certainty ) . This is only partly true ; Dallas had in fact decided to host games on Thanksgiving by their own decision because there was nothing else to do or watch on that day . In 1975 and 1977 , at the behest of then - Commissioner Pete Rozelle , the St. Louis Cardinals replaced Dallas as a host team ( Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976 ) . Although the Cardinals , at the time known as the `` Cardiac Cards '' due to their propensity for winning very close games , were a modest success at the time , they were nowhere near as popular nationwide as the Cowboys , who were regular Super Bowl contenders during this era . This , combined with St. Louis 's consistently weak attendance , a series of ugly Cardinals losses in the three - game stretch , and opposition from the Kirkwood -- Webster Groves Turkey Day Game ( a local high school football contest ) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978 ; it was then , after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games , that the Cowboys requested ( and received ) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day forever .", "answer": ["1966"]}, {"question": "when was penicillin first introduced to the public?", "context": "Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming .

Eliot , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work .

Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 , Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould .

The summit came to be known as the Group of Seven , or G7 , in 1976 with the addition of Canada . Russia was added to the political forum from 1997 , which the following year became known as the G8 . In March 2014 Russia was suspended following the annexation of Crimea , whereupon the group 's name reverted to the G7 . Certain representatives of G7 countries stated that they would be interested in Russia 's return to the group . However in 2017 Russia announced that it would permanently leave the political forum G8 . The European Union was represented at the G8 since the 1980s as a `` nonenumerated '' participant , but originally could not host or chair summits . The 40th summit was the first time the European Union was able to host and chair a summit . Collectively , in 2012 the G8 nations comprised 50.1 percent of 2012 global nominal GDP and 40.9 percent of global GDP ( PPP ) .", "answer": ["1997"]}, {"question": "who sang once upon a dream at the end of maleficent?", "context": "The song was covered by the American girl group No Secrets in 2003 for the two - disc DVD release , and by Emily Osment in October 2008 for the Platinum Edition release of the film , and also included on the compilation album Princess Disneymania .

The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 .

For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree .

Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons .

One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) . In Mesopotamia , the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation . The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies . It is because of this that the fertile crescent region , and Mesopotamia in particular , are often referred to as the cradle of civilization . The period known as the Ubaid period ( c. 6500 to 3800 BC ) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain , although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium . It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began . Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities , particularly in Northern Mesopotamia , and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south . Eridu is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period , around 5300 BC , and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period .

In just over a year , over 86,000 people migrated to California . This number is more than the number of migrants to that area during the 1849 Gold Rush . Migrants abandoned farms in Oklahoma , Arkansas , Missouri , Iowa , Nebraska , Kansas , Texas , Colorado , and New Mexico , but were often generally referred to as `` Okies '' , `` Arkies '' , or `` Texies '' .

Dust Bowl conditions fomented an exodus of the displaced from Texas , Oklahoma , and the surrounding Great Plains to adjacent regions . More than 500,000 Americans were left homeless . Over 350 houses had to be torn down after one storm alone . The severe drought and dust storms had left many homeless , others had their mortgages foreclosed by banks , and others felt they had no choice but to abandon their farms in search of work . Many Americans migrated west looking for work . Parents packed up `` jalopies '' with their families and a few personal belongings , and headed west in search of work .

The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain . The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity : `` Or rather -- He passed Us -- / The Dews drew quivering and chill -- '' ( 13 - 14 ) .

Other types of serialism also work with sets , collections of objects , but not necessarily with fixed - order series , and extend the technique to other musical dimensions ( often called `` parameters '' ) , such as duration , dynamics , and timbre .", "answer": ["Arnold Schoenberg"]}, {"question": "who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition?", "context": "Serialism of the first type is most specifically defined as the structural principle according to which a recurring series of ordered elements ( normally a set -- or row -- of pitches or pitch classes ) are used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity . Serialism is often broadly applied to all music written in what Arnold Schoenberg called `` The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another '' ( Schoenberg 1975 , 218 ; Anon . n.d. ) , or dodecaphony , and methods that evolved from his methods . It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series . In such usages post-Webernian serialism will be used to denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music . Other terms used to make the distinction are twelve - note serialism for the former , and integral serialism for the latter .", "answer": ["Arnold Schoenberg"]}, {"question": "what is the number of basic units in the international system of units?", "context": "The International System of Units ( SI ) defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other SI units can be derived .

Twelve - tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale , forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition 's melody , harmony , structural progressions , and variations .
